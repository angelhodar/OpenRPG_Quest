This simple but rich featured quests system will allow you to create **any type** of quest you want! **From linear based** (and boring) quests commonly seen in many RPG games (go to certain location, then talk to a NPC, then kill 5 amount of an especific monster, then..., and then finish the quest) **to tree based quests** that will allow you to **create subgoals requirements** that has to be completed before going to the next goal. Everthing easily customisable and ready to be as flexible as you may need.

## Features

- All quests data are **datatable driven**, so you can configure all your quests from a simple table!
- A default set of common quest types implemented out of the box: **timed quests**, **chainable**, **repeatable**, **unique**, etc.
- From **linear and single goal** based to **tree based subgoals** to meet your game history and requirements.
- Quests **rewards** system easily customisable to adapt to your own game logic.
- World quest **indicators** (enemies, NPC, locations, etc) and **goals progress tracking**.
